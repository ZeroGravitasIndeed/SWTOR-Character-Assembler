## As this standalone Add-on is falling behind the version integrated in the ZG SWTOR Tools in compatibility and features, I am deprecating it. Please [download and use the ZG SWTOR Tools Add-on, instead](https://github.com/SWTOR-Slicers/ZG-SWTOR-Tools).

# SWTOR Character Assembler

**This Blender Addon allows for the processing of [TORCommunity.com's Character Designer](https://github.com/SWTOR-Slicers/WikiPedia/wiki/Using-TORCommunity-Character-Designer)'s .zipped SWTOR characters folders directly from Blender.**

**At the moment we are updating this Add-on to work with a new version of the .gr2 Importer Add-on compatible with Blender 4.0.2. Until it is ready, please use the version of this tool integrated in the [ZeroGravitas SWTOR Tools Add-on](https://github.com/SWTOR-Slicers/ZG-SWTOR-Tools) (it has more corrections and features than this one: please check them in its [Wiki pages](https://github.com/SWTOR-Slicers/WikiPedia/wiki/ZG-SWTOR-Tools-Add-on))**
